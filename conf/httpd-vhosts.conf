# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.
#
NameVirtualHost *:<%= ENV["VCAP_APP_PORT"] %>

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#
# Proxy pass
#<VirtualHost *:<%= ENV["VCAP_APP_PORT"] %>>
   # ProxyRequests Off
   # ProxyPreserveHost On
    #ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
    #ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    #ErrorLog "logs/error.log"
    #CustomLog "logs/access.log" common
#</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:<%= ENV["VCAP_APP_PORT"] %>>
    JkMount /* worker1
</VirtualHost>
